# USB Host shield case data for v.1.1 with spacer

This is 3D print case data dedicated to the USB host shield with attached spacer.
 - USBHost_12.0mm_for_v1.1.f3d : Fusion 360 format
 - USBHost_12.0mm_for_v1.1.step : STEP format
 - USBHost_12.0mm_for_v1.1.stl : stl format

This is just reference data and I tried to print this data by AFINIA H800+.
If you print this data, it is necessary to output a thin wall, so it is recommended to rotate 45 degrees as shown below and print it.
